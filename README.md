# Dark Docs
A dark theme for Google Docs web, based on the colors used in its mobile app. 

Some subtle animations added. 

## Installation
1. Use a browser extension that applies user CSS themes to webpages, such as [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/).
2. Apply the stylesheet to URLs starting with `https://docs.google.com/document/`. (Copy all contents of the [dark-docs.css](dark-docs.css) file).

Dark Docs only works with Google Docs, and works best in Firefox (for now). There are plans to make themes for Google Sheets and Slides in the future.
