# Dark Docs
A dark theme for Google Docs web, based on the colors used in its mobile app. 

## Installation
1. Use a browser extension that applies user CSS themes to webpages, such as [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/).
2. Apply the stylesheets to URLs starting with `https://docs.google.com/document/d/`. (Copy all contents of the `.css` files. You may choose to paste them all in the same section, or add separate sections for each css file.)

Check the [Customization wiki](https://github.com/winghongchan/dark-docs/wiki/Customization) if you wish to add a wallpaper. 

Dark Docs only works with Google Docs. There are plans to make themes for Google Sheets and Slides in the future. If you create such a project (with a similar intent to this project), you may submit a pull request to include a link to it here.

## Contributing
The intent is simple - to make a dark mode for Google Docs web that shares the same colors and overall look to the Google Docs mobile app in dark mode. Check the [Design Guide wiki](https://github.com/winghongchan/dark-docs/wiki/Design-Guide) for guidance on using the color variables.
